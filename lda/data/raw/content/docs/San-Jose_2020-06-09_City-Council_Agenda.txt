The City of San José is committed to open and honest government and strives to consistently meet the 
community’s expectations by providing excellent service, in a positive and timely manner, and in the 
full view of the public. 

Welcome to the San José City Council meeting! 

This Agenda contains both a Consent Calendar section for routine business items that require Council 
approval, and general business items arranged to correspond with San José’s City Service Areas (CSAs). 
City Service Areas represent the policy-making level for strategic planning, policy setting, and investment 
decisions in the critical functions the City provides to the community. They are: 

• Strategic Support - The internal functions that enable the CSAs to provide direct 
   services to the community in an effective and efficient manner.

• Public Safety - Commitment to excellence in public safety by investing in neighborhood 
  partnerships as well as prevention, enforcement, and emergency preparedness services.

• Transportation & Aviation Services - A safe and efficient transportation system that contributes to 
  the livability and economic health of the City; and provide for the air transportation needs of the 
  community and the region at levels that is acceptable to the community.

• Environmental and Utility Services - Manage environmental services and utility systems to ensure 
  a sustainable environment for the community.   

• Neighborhood Services - Serve, foster, and strengthen community by providing access to lifelong 
   learning and opportunities to enjoy life.  

• Community & Economic Development - Manage the growth and change of the community in 
   order to create and preserve healthy neighborhoods and ensure a diverse range of employment and 
   housing opportunities.

You may speak to the City Council about any discussion item that is on the agenda, and you may also speak 
during Open Forum on items that are not on the agenda and are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the 
City Council or Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency Board. If you wish to speak to the City 
Council, please refer to the following guidelines:

o Fill out a Yellow Speaker’s Card and submit it to the City Clerk seated at the front table. Do 
   this before the meeting or before the item is heard. This will ensure that your name is called for 
   the item(s) that you wish to address, and it will help ensure the meeting runs smoothly for all 
   participants. 
o When the Council reaches your item on the agenda, the Mayor will open the public hearing and call 
   your name. Please address the Council from the podium, which is located to the left of the City 
   Clerk’s table. 

o Each speaker generally has two minutes to speak per item. The amount of time allotted to 
     speakers may vary at the Mayor’s discretion, depending on the number of speakers or the length 
     of the agenda. 
o To assist you in tracking your speaking time, there is a display on the podium. The green light 
     turns on when you begin speaking; the yellow light turns on when you have 30 seconds left; and 
     the red light turns on when your speaking time is up. 

Please be advised that, by law, the City Council is unable to discuss or take action on issues presented during 
Open Forum. According to State Law (the Brown Act) items must first be noticed on the agenda before any 
discussion or action.

The San José City Council meets every Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 6 p.m. as needed, 
unless otherwise noted.  The City Council, or less than a quorum, may adjourn any regular, special 
or adjourned meeting to a later date, time and place specified in the order of adjournment.  If all 
members are absent, the City Clerk may declare the meeting adjourned to a stated date, time and 
place. If you have any questions, please direct them to the City Clerk’s staff seated at the tables 
just below the dais.  Thank you for taking the time to attend today’s meeting.  We look forward to 
seeing you at future meetings.

kinetic impact projectiles (KIP), i.e., rubber of foams bullets, either by 
directing the City Manager to amend the SJPD Duty Manual, or 
alternatively directing the City Attorney to amend San José Municipal 
Code Section 10.32. Specifically:
(1) Reveal whether the safety of KIP design or composition has 
substantially improved since the time of the studies referenced in this 
memorandum, below;
(2) Describe the approximate number of rounds discharged in crowds 
over the past week;
(3) Explicitly evaluate the relative imprecision of this tool, and its 
likelihood of striking persons other than its intended targets; and
(4) Compare options, including (a) other less-than-lethal tools, other 
than a batonstrike;
(b) substantially reducing the frequency of their use by raising the 
threshold justifying discharge, and (c) an assessment of whether any 
alternative KIP composition will reduce the risk of harm to members of 
the public.

(e) To provide greater transparency to the public and accountability:
(1) For the approximately half-dozen video clips that have raised 
substantial public concern on social media regarding potential SJPD 
misconduct or possible unlawful use of force, release to the public any 
videos in possession or readily available to SJPD that provide a fuller 
picture of the incident, such as longer duration (particularly the period 
prior to the video clip in question), alternative view angles, etc., within 
two weeks, so long as consistent with what is allowable under California 
state law.
i. Those videos should include, at a minimum,
• the incident involving the collision between the police motorcycle and 
the running pedestrian, and
• the incident involving a physical altercation between police and a male 
who is pulled back behind the police line by multiple officers, and 
subjected to repeated blows by police, and
• the incident involving an officer responding to a protester with 
expletives
(2) At the earliest opportunity for public hearing-whether at our 
upcoming Independent Police Auditor use of force review or for the 
after-action report-- public hearing, present to the Council and public 
the IPA and SJPD findings relating to investigations and investigation 
reviews of each of those clips.
(f) Establish a process, consistent with that advocated by the Obama 
Foundation’s My Brother’s Keeper Alliance Mayoral Action Pledge, to 
review our “use of force” policies, engage our community, seek the 
feedback of our community on the findings, and reform those policies 
consistent with the best thinking nationally. The process should engage 
the entire community, including faith leaders, social justice advocates, 
leadership within our communities of color, criminal justice experts, the 
police union, the police rank-and-file,
the Chief of Police, and the Independent Police Auditor.
(g) Return to Council by the first week of August with ballot language 
articulating the expansion of authority for the Independent Police 
Auditor. This language should provide a higher level of transparency 
and accountability over “use of force” investigations and access to 
police records, including body worn camera footage, as achieved 
through negotiation with the Police Officers’ Association. Further 
explore additional expansion of IPA authority within the legal 
parameters mandated by the California Supreme Court’s decision in 
Seal Beach Peace Officers Association v. Seal Beach. This can include 
language to allow for future expansion of authority through a meet and

CITY OF SAN JOSE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PUBLIC MEETINGS IN

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS AND COMMITTEE ROOMS

The Code of Conduct is intended to promote open meetings that welcome debate of public policy issues being 
discussed by the City Council, their Committees, and City Boards and Commissions in an atmosphere of 
fairness, courtesy, and respect for differing points of view. 

1. Public Meeting Decorum: 

a) Persons in the audience will refrain from behavior which will disrupt the public meeting.  
    This will include making loud noises, clapping, shouting, booing, hissing or engaging in 
    any other activity in a manner that disturbs, disrupts or impedes the orderly conduct of the   
    meeting. 
b) Persons in the audience will refrain from creating, provoking or participating in any type   
    of disturbance involving unwelcome physical contact. 
c) Persons in the audience will refrain from using cellular phones and/or pagers while the 
    meeting is in session. 
d) Appropriate attire, including shoes and shirts are required in the Council Chambers and 
    Committee Rooms at all times. 
e) Persons in the audience will not place their feet on the seats in front of them. 
f) No food, drink (other than bottled water with a cap), or chewing gum will be allowed in the 
   Council Chambers and Committee Rooms, except as otherwise pre-approved by City staff. 
g) All persons entering the Council Chambers and Committee Rooms, including their bags,   
    purses, briefcases and similar belongings, may be subject to search for weapons and other 
   dangerous materials. 

2. Signs, Objects or Symbolic Material: 

a) Objects and symbolic materials, such as signs or banners, will be allowed in the Council   
    Chambers and Committee Rooms, with the following restrictions: § No objects will be

        -No sticks, posts, poles or other such items will be attached to the signs or other 
         symbolic materials. 
        -The items cannot create a building maintenance problem or a fire or safety hazard. 

b) Persons with objects and symbolic materials such as signs must remain seated when   
    displaying them and must not raise the items above shoulder level, obstruct the view or 
    passage of other attendees, or otherwise disturb the business of the meeting.
